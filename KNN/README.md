# KNN (homework â„–1)

KNN.ipynb contains the main results of this homework (in Russian, sorry). In the notebook binary and multiclass KNN classification methods are realized by me and also there is a simple implementation KNN regression model (from sklearn library).

knn.py contains the script of KNN classifier class with some attributes and methods which are used in the notebook.

metrics.py contains some metrics-computing scripts which are used in the notebook. All of them are duplicate metrics from sklearn.metrics, haha.

To run the notebook on your local PC, you need to download all python scripts from this folder and install the next libraries:

* numpy
* matplotlib
* pandas
* sklearn
* seaborn

(in requirements.txt)
